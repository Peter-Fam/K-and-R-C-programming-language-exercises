# K-and-R-C-programming-language-exercises
My solutions to K&amp;R C programming language Exercises

Some of them are sloppy but for the most parts gets the job done.

I tried to keep the solutions short and simple and didn't use any .h files,so each exercise is a standalone program.

## Missing
* Exercise 8-5
## Usage
each exercise is located at ```Chapter#/Exercises/##.c``` where ```#``` is the chapter number and ```##``` is the exercise number.

To compile all the exercises at once (tested on linux machine with gcc),Use ``` $ make``` in the main directory

## TODO
* Adding some tests and refractoring some sloppy exercises
* Adding better explanatory comments to a couple of complex exercises
